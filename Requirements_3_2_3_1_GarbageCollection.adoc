==== {chapter-id}.{chapter-sub-id}.{counter:section-id}. Garbage Collection shall be explicitly defined

When an API defines the use of automatic garbage collection mechanisms the API should provide means to explicitly invoke the garbage collection algorithms. Garbage collection should only be done during an explicit invocation of garbage collector.

In APIs where garbage collection reference counting is done by multiple processes, i.e. CPU and GPU, or multiple threads. The automatic garbage collection of objects can cause non deterministic behavior within an executing program.
