==== {chapter-id}.{chapter-sub-id}.{counter:section-id}. Garbage Collection Methods

Similar to asynchronous immediately handled events, automatic garbage collection can have similar 
problems where the worst case execution time of a system can be very hard to quantify for safety
certification. As such APIs should not define an automatic garbage collection mechanism which
may be triggered by an event other than the application specifically invoking a garbage collection
function. Where the API uses reference counting to determine when to start garbage collection 
activities the API should only allow changes to the reference count to be caused by the application.
At no points should the application allow a secondary processing entity to change the reference count
outside of control of the application.
