===== shall
When used with reference in the context of the Khronos SC Requirements Document the word *shall* is the equivalent to a mandatory requirement. Some functional safety standards like ISO 26262 and RFC 2119 give clear definitions for this word and other words like *should* and *may* (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt]).

===== should
When used with reference in the context of the Khronos SC Requirements Document the word *should* is the equivalent to a recommended requirement.

===== requirement
When used with reference in the context of the Khronos SC Requirements Document the word *requirement* means a requirement listed in the table of requirements or a requirement sub-part that is compulsory, a necessary condition, behavior or action that must be implemented or carried out.

===== guideline
When used with reference in the context of the Khronos SC Requirements Document the word *guideline* means a guideline listed in the table of guidelines or a guideline sub-part that is a principle, piece of advice, instruction that by the discretion of the reader may or may not be implemented or carried out.

===== must
When used alone, this word, or the term 'required', means that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification. When followed by not (“must not” ), the phrase means that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.

===== should
When used alone, this word means that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. When followed by not (“should not”), means that there exists valid reasons in particular circumstances why a requirement should not be followed, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

===== may
This word, or the adjective optional, means that an item is truly optional. One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor 4
feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item. An implementation which does not include a particular option must be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does include a particular option must be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides).

===== can and cannot
The additional terms *can* and *cannot* are to be interpreted as follows:

*can*

This word means that the particular behavior described is a valid choice for an application, and is never used to refer to implementation behavior.

*cannot*

This word means that the particular behavior described is not achievable by an application. For example, an entry point does not exist, or shader code is not capable of expressing an operation.

NOTE: There is an important distinction between *cannot* and *must not*, as used in this document. *Cannot* means something the application literally is unable to express or accomplish through the API, while *must not* means something that the application is capable of expressing through the API, but that the consequences of doing so are undefined and potentially unrecoverable for the implementation.

NOTE: The key words *must*, *required*, *shall*, *should*, *recommend*, *may*, and *optional* in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119:
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt.
